# :smile: Hi, I’m @adenoz (Deno)

- :house: I’m interested in learning about next-generation smart home automation
- :chart: Somewhat related, I aim to learn about data analytics as I go
- :key: I’m currently learning about ssh as I setup wiki.js to capture my learning
- :wave: I’m looking to collaborate on interesting things

## Next-generation smart home automation

This effort will be the main long project I explore and learn about here. I am expecting this effort to last years rather than months or even weeks.

I am aiming to use [home-assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.io) as the centre of this system. I aim to develop a strong security and safety system as the main component which will use machine learning image recognition for not only security (people and cars) but also safety (such as detect fire). The hardware will likely involve Nvidia GPUs.

Testing. Other edit.

## Data analytics

I have long had an interest in data analytics and I intend to put more time in to learning. I have delved into R which is a great language but am now erring towards Python. I know.

I'm expecting to setup [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) and learn SQL (and therefore PostgreSQL and InfluxDB) to up my analytics game. I've used Tableau and it was ok but want to focus on open source offerings.

## Learning

I think setting up a wiki of some sort is the best way to start with any learning as you can start documenting right away. I have decided to go with [wiki.js](https://github.com/Requarks/wiki) because it is modern and fast but also because I can write in markdown and have my wikis sync with github.

## Collaborate?

While I don't think I'll be submitting pull requests any time soon, I certainly have an intent to contribute to the projects I am interested in and will be using.

## Extras

I also like playing guitar. And drinking (and smelling) nice coffee. And cycling (road and mountain). I have a knack of finding too many things interesting and never really excelling at any one of them. But this time, it's different #eyeroll
