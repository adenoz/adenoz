- :house: I’m interested in learning about next-generation smart home automation
- :chart: Somewhat related, I aim to learn about data analytics as I go

## Next-generation smart home automation

This effort will be the main long project I will explore and learn about here. I am expecting this effort to last years rather than months or even weeks. When a bit more mature, I'll start a repo to capture and manage everything.

I've begun using [home-assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.io) as the centre of this system. I aim to develop a strong security and safety system as the main component which will use machine learning image recognition to detect for not only security (people and cars) but also safety (such as detect fire). The hardware will likely involve Nvidia GPUs.

## Data analytics

I have long had an interest in data analytics and I intend to put more time in to learning. I have delved into R which is a great language but am now erring towards Python. I know.

I've begun using [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) and will learn SQL (and hav begun using PostgreSQL and InfluxDB) to up my analytics game. I've used Tableau and it was ok but want to focus on open source offerings.

## Learning

I think setting up a wiki of some sort is the best way to start with any learning as you can start documenting right away. I've decided to go with [wiki.js](https://github.com/Requarks/wiki) because it is modern and fast and also because I can write in markdown and have my wikis sync with github.
